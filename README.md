-- AronChupa & Little Sis Nora - Trombone

Hello! Me once again. Saw a request for this song in the Trombone Champ Discord... and the name means by law, this is required in the game. Enjoy! Thank you for over 700 views on my last chart! Insane numbers. Never expected to have so much interest in my custom charts!

Please be kind, as I am constantly learning how to improve my charting skills. As of now, there is no scheduled revision of this chart, meaning this could be the final draft of this song.

Please note if you have downloaded this from GitHub the background quality will be poorer quality than downloads from the Discord. To download this head to the Trombone Champ Modding Discord and navigate to #custom-charts and search the name of this song.

-- INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
